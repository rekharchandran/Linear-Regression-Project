Based on tutorials from the python course(Source:Pierian data), here I find all necessary documents to learn from or use it for future goals.
### Introduction

The data is from a Ecommerce company based in New York City that sells clothing online but they also have in-store style and clothing advice sessions. Customers come in to the store, have sessions/meetings with a personal stylist, then they can go home and order either on a mobile app or website for the clothes they want.
The company is trying to decide whether to focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or their website.
