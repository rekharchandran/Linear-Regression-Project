Based on tutorials from the python course(Source:Pierian data), here I find all necessary documents to learn from or use it for future goals.

### Introduction

The data is from a Ecommerce company based in New York City that sells clothing online but they also have in-store style and clothing advice sessions. Customers come in to the store, have sessions/meetings with a personal stylist, then they can go home and order either on a mobile app or website for the clothes they want.
The company is trying to decide whether to focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or their website. 


### Information about the data 
 The csv file has customer information such as Email, Address, and their color Avatar. Then it also has numerical value columns:

Avg. Session Length: Average session of in-store style advice sessions.
Time on App: Average time spent on App in minutes
Time on Website: Average time spent on Website in minutes
Length of Membership: How many years the customer has been a member.
